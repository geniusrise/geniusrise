    üóÑÔ∏è **RedisState**: A state manager that stores state in Redis.

    This manager provides a fast, in-memory storage solution using Redis.

    ## Attributes:
    - `redis` (redis.Redis): The Redis connection.

    ## Usage:
    ```python
    manager = RedisState(host="localhost", port=6379, db=0)
    manager.set_state("user123", {"status": "active"})
    state = manager.get_state("user123")
    print(state)  # Outputs: {"status": "active"}
    ```

    Ensure Redis is accessible and running.
