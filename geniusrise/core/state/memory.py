    üß† **InMemoryState**: A state manager that stores state in memory.

    This manager is useful for temporary storage or testing purposes. Since it's in-memory, the data will be lost once the application stops.

    ## Attributes:
    - `store` (Dict[str, Dict]): The in-memory store for states.

    ## Usage:
    ```python
    manager = InMemoryState()
    manager.set_state("user123", {"status": "active"})
    state = manager.get_state("user123")
    print(state)  # Outputs: {"status": "active"}
    ```

    Remember, this is an in-memory store. Do not use it for persistent storage!
